# void-install-script
TUI Shell script installer for Void Linux

This installer was primarily created to serve as an installer with encryption support while also having general installation options one would want, with sane defaults.

The overall goal of this installer is to deploy a system that is ready to use as soon as the installer exits.

At the moment, this installer does not have stable releases. The most recent commit should be considered the most recent stable release. Of course, if you run into bugs, please create an issue. (Or, if you're inclined, create a pull request to fix it.)

# Features
```
-Option to add user-created modules to be executed by the installer, see modules notes
-Included modules do various things, a few included ones:
--Option to enable system logging with socklog
--Option to install wifi firmware and basic utilities
--Option to install Flatpak with Flathub repository
--Option to install and preconfigure qemu and libvirt
--Option to install nftables with a default firewall config
--Various security related modules

-Option to choose between grub and UKI to boot the system

-Option to encrypt installation disk
--With UKI setup, encryption will encrypt both /boot and / using luks2
--With grub setup, encryption will encrypt both /boot and / using luks1

-Option to pre-install and pre-configure the following:
--Graphics drivers (amd, nvidia, intel, nvidia-nouveau, none)
--Networking (dhcpcd, NetworkManager, none)
--Audio server (pipewire, pulseaudio, none)
--DE or WM (gnome, kde, xfce, sway, swayfx, wayfire, i3, niri, none)
--Or, choose to do none of these and install a bare-minimum system

-Option to choose between LVM and a traditional install
-Option to choose between zswap, swap partition, and normal swapfile
-Option to securely erase the installation disk with shred
-Option to choose between doas or sudo
-Option to choose your repository mirror
-Option to choose between linux, linux-lts, and linux-mainline kernels
-Option to choose between xfs and ext4 filesystems
-Configure partitions in the installer for home, swap, and root with LVM
-Support for both glibc and musl
-User creation and basic configuration
```

# UKI notes

UKI setup *will* provide full-disk-encryption as both / and /boot will be encrypted with luks2 as opposed to luks1 with grub.

Do keep in mind potential security issues regarding weaker key derivation functions, such as pbkdf2 which is used with luks1, rather than argon2id with luks2.

UKIs *can* both be a bit touchy on some (non entirely UEFI standards compliant) motherboards, though this doesn't seem to be much of a problem as long as we "trick" boards into not deleting the boot entry.

The default UKI location is ``/boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi``, and it is recommended to leave it in this location so as to not have to regenerate the boot entry with efibootmgr, but also to maintain compatibility with spotty UEFI implementations.

With UKIs, kernel parameters are set in ``/etc/kernel.d/post-install/60-ukify``, to update these, modify this file and run a reconfigure on your kernel.

# Modules notes

A barebones "module" system has been added to the installer to make adding misc features simpler and more organized.

To create a module, create a file in the 'modules' directory that comes with this installer, its name should be the title of your module.

Then, add at minimum the 3 required variables and 1 required function to this file.
If any of the 3 required variables or the 1 required function are missing, the installer will not import the module.

Example module file contents:

```
title=nameofmymodule
description="- This module does XYZ"
status=off

main() {
    # Do cool stuff here
}
```

The title variable here will both be the name of the entry in the TUI, but also the name of the file the installer will look for.

The description variable will be the extra information given to the user in the TUI along with the option and can be left empty, but must exist.

The status variable tells the installer whether or not the module should be enabled or disabled by default, valid values are on/off.

Inside of the main() function, you're free to add any commands you'd like to be executed, and you can access all variables set by the primary install script.



That's it!

Feel free to check out some of the installers included modules for further example.

# Hidden installer options

There are a few options that aren't exposed directly to the user because they can potentially be dangerous, but can be changed by creating a file that sets these variables and adding it as a flag when executing the installer.

Example: 
```
./installer.sh /path/to/file
```

Such file would contain any or all of the following options, and the following examples are set to their default values:

```
acpi="true"
hash="sha512"
keysize="512"
itertime="10000"
basesystem="*" # Define base system packages instead of using metapackage
```

If none of these variables are set in the file, or no file is provided, the above defaults will be used.

The toggle for ACPI can be set to false if you are facing ACPI related issues. This will set the "acpi=off" kernel parameter on the new install. Do not change this setting unless absolutely necessary.

hash, keysize, and itertime are all variables that change the LUKS settings for encrypted installations.

I do not recommend changing hash and keysize from their default values unless you are absolutely certain you would like to. Research this before changing values.

itertime is a bit less strict. As a TL;DR, the higher this value is, the longer brute-forcing this drive should take. 

The value here will equal the amount of time it takes to unlock the drive in milliseconds calculated for the system this is ran on. If this drive is then put into a system with a faster CPU, it will unlock quicker.

The LUKS default is "2000", or 2 seconds. The default in this installer has been raised with systems that have slower CPUs (and users that are more security conscious) in mind.

The fips140 compliant value here would be 600000 according to owasp, though this would result in a 10 minute disk unlock time.

Outside of options that are potentially dangerous, "random" features that do not fit elsewhere can be added via this.

# Misc notes

This installer is not officially supported, and is still fairly work-in-progress. If you run into any problems please file them on this github page.

This installer only supports x86_64-efi. I currently have no plans to support anything else.

If you have found this script useful, do star this repository!

# Contributing

The best way to contribute to this would be to create a pull request adding the feature you would like.

If you would like a change to be made to the script, a request/suggestion in the issues tracker is also a wonderful place to start.

# TODO
```
-Add manual partitioning
-Split security modules into their own menu
-ZFS support with zfsbootmenu is planned
-Add more bootloader choices such as limine and systemd-boot 
-You tell me, or, open a PR adding what you want.
```
